My drill is the drill that will pierce the heavens!
%
Just who the hell do you think I am?!
%
Big Brother is dead. He's no longer here. However, on my back, and within my heart, he lives on in me!
I will put a hole in heaven itself.
Even if that hole becomes my grave, as long as I break through, that is my victory!  Who do you think I am?
I'm Simon. I'm not my brother, Kamina. I AM MYSELF! Simon The Digger!
%
Maybe, but it isn't zero. As far as I'm concerned, that makes it the same as a 100% chance.

We evolve beyond the person we were a minute before!
Little by little we advance a bit further with each turn! That's how a drill works!!
%
Mark my words! This drill will open a hole in the universe! 
And that hole will be a path for those behind us! The dreams of those who've fallen! 
The hopes of those who'll follow! Those two sets of dreams weave together into a double helix! 
Drilling a path towards tomorrow! And that's Tengen Toppa! That's Gurren Lagann!! 
My drill is the drill...that creates the heavens!!!
%
My drill is the heart of my soul.
%
Let's see you grit those teeth!... Have you snapped out of it yet?
I give you my word that if you ever start to doubt yourself I'll come and belt you one.
%
Kick logic out and do the impossible! That's how Team Gurren rolls!
%
Get going Simon. 
Just don't be distracted by the what-ifs, should-haves, and if-onlys. 
The one thing you choose for yourself, that is the truth of your universe.
%
So this is the power of the Spiral. Not bad, not bad at all...
%
Do you seriously think it's gonna be wiped out by the likes of you?!
%
This is Simon's soul... Team Dai-Gurren's soul... Humanity's soul.. and actually, it's my soul!!
%
Those who are dead, are dead. 
If we bring them back to life they'll just get in the way of the next generation, right?
%
No that's your limitation!
You sit here closed off, locking away other life forms like some kind of king! 
That's nobody's limitation but your own!
%
Don't underestimate us!
We don't care about time or space or multi-dimensional whatevers, we don't give a damn about that!
Force your way down a path you choose to take and do it all yourself! That's the way Team Dai-Gurren rolls!
